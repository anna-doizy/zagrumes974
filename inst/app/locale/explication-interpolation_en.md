The map on the right shows density interpolations in citrus or disease. 
The warmer the colours, the higher the density.


#### Citrus density

Estimation of the **density of citrus plots** cultivated in RÃ©union.
This does not vary with time.


#### Density of HLB

Estimation of the **density of HLB positive cases in relation to the density of citrus trees at each point of the landscape**. 
This map should be interpreted in relation to the density of citrus trees, as the less dense areas may be either citrus-growing areas spared from HLB, or areas without citrus trees and therefore without HLB.

The graph below represents the known health status of the citrus plot in 2020.
