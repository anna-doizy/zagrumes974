> **Zagrumes974** is the web application for the epidemiological monitoring of citrus fruit against HLB in Réunion.

It is mainly intended for surveillance stakeholders, but is accessible to any public wishing to have an idea of the sanitary situation.

## How to use it

This **homepage** introduces the biology of the HLB disease.

The tab **HLB in Réunion** shows you an interactive map of the presence of HLB in Réunion by period, altitude and commune

The page **Modelling an epidemic** proposes different sets of parameters in order to simulate the propagation of a disease similar to HLB in a fictitious plot for educational purposes.

In **About**, you will find links to further research as well as the different actors who participated in this work.



## Background

**Greening**, or **Huanglongbing** (HLB) or yellow shoot disease, is a bacterial disease of citrus fruit transmitted by insect vectors.
HLB was first reported in China in 1943 and quickly spread around the world.

This disease is characterised by the obstruction of sap channels, dieback and systematic death of the tree.
Before reaching dieback and death of the infected tree, between 2 to 6 years after the onset of the symptomatic phase, the following symptoms can be observed: asymmetric yellowing of the leaves and *flushes*: asymmetric fruits of small size and inverted coloration with aborted seeds.

</p>

One of the most constraining aspects for the detection of the disease is the asymptomatic phase of infected hosts. 
Indeed, a so-called cryptic phase exists in HLB-infected citrus and can last from 6 months to 2 years. 
Once visible, symptoms, including leaf yellowing, may be mistaken for deficiencies.

No treatment is conclusive at present. The main control method therefore remains the uprooting of infected trees.

In Réunion, a first HLB epidemic occurred in the 1970s-1980s in connection with the presence of two species of bacteria (*Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus* and *Candidatus Liberibacter africanus*) and the two species of psyllid vectors *Trioza erytreae* and *Diaphorina citri*.

The observed populations suggest that only *Diaphorina citri* is an active vector in the re-emergence of HLB which has affected Réunion since 2015. 
As altitude is a limiting factor for these psyllids, the disease cannot be present above 800 metres or at least cannot spread at these altitudes.

To control the disease, diseased plants were removed in large numbers, healthy plants were supplied and psyllid parasitoids were introduced in 1974 and 1978. Due to the absence of a secondary parasite, *Tamarixia dryi* and *Tamarixia radiata* effectively parasitized *Trioza erytreae* and *Diaphorina citri* respectively. Psyllid populations decreased in the orchards, but also outside, for example on *Murraya paniculata*, a vector reservoir.

Since 2015, new cases of HLB have been observed on the island. Parasitoids are still present, no psyllid outbreaks are noted and it is mainly *Diaphorina citri* that is observed.
